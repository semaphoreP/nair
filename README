Python library to calculate the index of refraction of air in the near infrared.

This library offers three models to calculate the index of refraction. The first is a simple equation from Henry Roe's paper (http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0201273v1.pdf). Its implementation is named nRoe. The next is a multivariable Taylor expansion from Richard Mather (http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0610256v2.pdf). Its implementation is named nMather. The third one is a Sellmeier-equation based model from  Voronin & Zheltikov (2017) (https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46111). This model has not been tested for correctness currently.

While I did not find an explicit range of valid wavelengths for Roe's equation, Mather's equation is only valid between 1.3 and 2.5 microns. 

Also included is a python script that plots a comparison of these two equtions. They agree up to a precision of 1E-7.
